# Movie-Recommendation-system

There are three types of Recommendation System 
1. Content Based -- it recommends based on the similarity of contents watched by the user only.
2. Collaborative Filtering -- we tend to find similar users and recommend what similar users like. classify the users into clusters of similar types and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster.
3. Hybrid -- combination of both content based and collaborative filtering

Recommendation systems are used in various online platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, and for different types of products like movies.
