# Movie-Recommendation-system

There are three types of Recommendation System 
1. Content Based -- it recommends based on the similarity of contents
2. Collaborative Filtering -- it recommends based on the user's interests. So Anybody who has the similar interests will have similar recommendations in their home page.
3. Hybrid -- combination of both content based and collaborative filtering

Recommendation systems are used in various online platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, and for different types of products like movies.
   
**High quality recommendation systems lead to increased conversion rates and revenue**
